# Typescript Template

A basic TypeScript template to use for new projects

1. Contains prettier + eslint support
2. VScode integration to format on safe
3. Proper TSConfig and build scripts + dependencies


## Pre-Requisites

1. Make sure https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint extension is installed
2. Make sure https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode extension is installed

## Trouble-Shooting

If linting does not work:
1. Check output (Terminal → Output → Eslint) to check for errors
2. Restart ESLint -> Cmd+Shift+P → ESLint: Restart ESLint Server

## Remarks

* Semicolons are off
* Single quotes
* Otherwise pretty much standard
